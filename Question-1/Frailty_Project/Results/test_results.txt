Obsrvation 1: Performed correlation on Frailty data and Found the following results

	1) Highest positive correlation coefficient: 0.5715249798799161
	Variable pair with the highest positive correlation: ('Height', 'Weight')

	2) Highest negative correlation coefficient: -0.4758668672668008
	Variable pair with the highest negative correlation: ('Grip strength', 'Frailty')

Observation 2: Checked for the outliers in the data

	Outliers detected:
	Height           False
	Weight           False
	Age              False
	Grip strength    False
	Frailty          False

==>No outliers detected

Observation 3: Performed p-test on the data taking the Frailty column
output:	T-statistic: 0.0
	P-value: 1.0
==> so it is stating that there is no statistical evidence to support the presence of an effect or difference between the groups being compared, and any observed differences are likely due to random variation.
